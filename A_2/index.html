        <h2>Magic shop</h2>
        <p>On days where I hate myself for being me
            <br>On days where I want to disappear forever
            <br>Let's make a door, it's in your heart
            <br>Open the door and this place will await, Magic Shop
            <br><br>While drinking a glass of hot tea
            <br>And looking up at the Milky Way
            <br>You'll be alright, oh, this here is the Magic Shop
        </p>

        <h2>Zero o'clock</h2>
        <p> Come home and lie in bed
            <br>Thinking if it was my fault?
            <br>Dizzy night, looking at the clock
            <br>Soon it will be midnight
            <br><br>And you're gonna be happy
            <br>Like that snow that just settled down
            <br>Let's breathe, like the first time
            <br>And you're gonna be happy
            <br>Turn this all around
            <br>When everything is new, zero o'clock

        <h2>Love Myself</h2>
        <p> Inside of me, there's still
            <br>That awkward part of me but
            <br><br>You've shown me I have reasons
            <br>I should love myself
            <br>I'll answer with my breath, my path
            <br><br>The me of yesterday
            <br>The me of today
            <br>The me of tomorrow
            <br>With no exceptions, it's all me
