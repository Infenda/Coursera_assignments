					Chicken
				</div>
				<p>
					The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild
					species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia.
					Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A
					male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually
					immature female is called a pullet.

					Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until
					the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC). Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of
					food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

					Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
					billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than
					any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion,
					and in language and literature.

					Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
					Asia,but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
					Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
					Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the
					"bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
					according to the annals of Thutmose III.

					Beef
				</div>
				<p>
					Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus).

					In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous
					breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef
					is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United
					States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.

					Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying
					degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef
					contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is
					associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when
					processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the
					highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.
					Beef cattle are raised and fed using a variety of methods, including feedlots, free range, ranching,
					backgrounding and intensive animal farming. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), commonly
					referred to as factory farms, are commonly used to meet the demand of beef production. CAFOs supply
					70.4% of cows in the US market and 99% of all meat in the United States supply. Cattle CAFOs can
					also be a source of E. coli contamination in the food supply due to the prevalence of manure in
					CAFOs.

					Sushi
				</div>
				<p>
					Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice , usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied
					by a variety of ingredients , such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its
					presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or
					sumeshi.

					The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of
					sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in
					the Edo period (1603–1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.

					Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice
					or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon,
					tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled
					ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes
					for the dish.

					Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly
					sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.
					The common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared sushi rice. Fillings, toppings, condiments,
					and preparation vary widely.

					Due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is pronounced with zu instead of su when a prefix is
					attached, as in nigirizushi.

					Chirashizushi

					Chirashizushi with raw ingredients
					Chirashizushi serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable
					garnishes. It is commonly eaten because it is filling, fast and easy to make.[citation needed] It is
					eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March and Kodomonohi in May.
